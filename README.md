#Codeacademy Ravenous Project

This is a Spotify web application built with reactjs [https://reactjs.org/]  

# Features

* Spotify Login — the first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account. You will need to follow the steps in the Spotify Developer Guide to register your application.
* Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button. The app will request song data about the user's input from the Spotify library (find Spotify endpoints here).

* Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track's display container.
